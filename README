DineOut is a restaurant reservation system. The main idea of this project is to build an efficient restaurant reservation application where users can easily reserve a table at any restaurant of their choice, thereby making the whole dining out experience convenient. This application, having two portals, services users and restaurant owners. The application would provide the users with the detailed information of the restaurants based on the location or cuisine provided by the user. The application would also provide the restaurant owners to add their restaurants into the portal or make changes to their existing restaurants in the portal. The users can check the other user ratings and reviews. This helps them ease the reservation process. Reservation of tables are made based on the available sitting area.
